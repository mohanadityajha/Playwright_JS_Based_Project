   Question 2. What is the Playwright framework, and what are its key features?
   Playwright is a Node.js library developed by Microsoft that automates Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit with a single API. Developers writing JavaScript code can use these APIs to build new browser pages, navigate to URLs, and interact with page elements. Furthermore, because Microsoft Edge is based on the open-source Chromium web framework, Playwright may automate Microsoft Edge.
   Some key features make Playwright different:
   (a). Cross-browser development on Chromium, WebKit, and Firefox is supported, including Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera, and Safari. Cross-platform execution is possible on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

   (b).Cross-language testing, including JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, and .NET, allows you to choose the best environment for you while covering all regions and formats.

   (c).Keep track of logs and videos effortlessly using auto-wait, clever assertions that retry until an element is located, and test data tracing.

   (d).Playwright frameworks take full-page screenshots of the webpage, which makes visual testing easier.

   (e).It is built with current architecture and no constraints, allowing you to interact with multi-page, multi-tab websites like a genuine user, and effortlessly handles frames and browser events.

   (f).Because the Playwright framework is built on the architecture of modern browsers, it does not have the constraints of an in-process test runner.
                                                 OR
   The key features of Playwright include:
   Cross-browser support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and more)
   Record and replay functionality for test creation
   Network interception for mocking or modifying network requests
   Support for headless and non-headless modes
   Automatic waiting for page and element states
   Accessibility testing
   Visual regression testing

  Question 3. What programming languages does Playwright support?
  Here is the list of programming languages Playwright supports:
  JavaScript/Node.js
  TypeScript
  Python
  C#
  Java

  Question 4.Can you describe Playwright's architecture?
  Playwright uses a single WebSocket connection to communicate with all drivers, which is kept open until testing is complete, instead of having separate connections for each driver. This lowers the number of potential failure sites by enabling rapid command transmission via a single link.

  Question 5.Can We perform tests for Playwright using Jasmine?
  Yes, we can use Jasmine as the test runner for Playwright since Jest and Jasmine have nearly identical syntax.

  Question 6.Can I run tests parallelly in Playwright?
  Yes, Playwright enables parallel test execution, enabling you to speed up your test suite by running several tests concurrently. A test runner that supports parallel execution, such as Jest or Mocha, can be used to execute tests in parallel.

  Question 7.How does Playwright handle browser automation and testing?
  Through a single API, the Playwright library offers cross-browser automation. Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit can all be automated using a single API, thanks to the Playwright Node.js module. Playwright makes cross-browser online automation that is evergreen, competent, dependable, and quickly possible.
  Here are the steps you can follow to handle browser automation in Playwright:
  Install the Playwright test to perform a test on your website:
  npm i -D @Playwright/test
  Install browsers on which you want to run a test with the command given below:
  npx Playwright install
  Write a tiny script for automation testing. Here is an example of running the Playwright test in Chrome browser.
  const { chromium } = require('Playwright');
   (async () => {
   // Launch a Chrome browser instance
   const browser = await chromium.launch();
   })

  Question 8. How does Playwright differ from other testing frameworks?
  Released in 2020, Playwright is gaining popularity every day. The Playwright is registering 1.3 million downloads every week on NPM as of April 2023. The reason is it has many advantages over other frameworks. It enables you to test complex web applications across several browsers. It gives superior test coverage and reliable findings. Additionally, there are several benefits to automating your web testing. Such as:

  8(a) It includes capabilities for step-by-step debugging, exploring selectors, and recording new tests. It is accessible as a VS Code addon.
  8(b) To examine test execution results in a browser, Playwright creates an HTML report. Visual discrepancies and test artifacts like screenshots, traces, error logs, and video recordings are included.
  8(c) Playwright installation just takes a few minutes to be configured. However, the installation procedure may vary depending on the programming language you use with Playwright to perform the tests.
  8(d) Playwright offers a high-level API that frees you from dealing with low-level browser interactions so that you may design tests that are easier to comprehend and manage.
  8(e) Playwright includes built-in parallelism support, allowing you to run tests simultaneously across many browsers or computers, which can help you save time and expedite your test runs.
  8(f) You can test your application on various mobile devices and screen sizes because of Playwright's ability to emulate mobile devices.

  Question 9.Is there any Webdriver dependency in Playwright?
  No, Playwright is not dependent on WebDriver. Playwright communicates with the browser via a different protocol than WebDriver-based automation tools. It uses the DevTools protocol, a more advanced and effective method of controlling the browser. Playwright differentiates itself from other automation tools by providing better cross-browser support and more advanced features such as network interception and visual regression testing. It also allows for parallel testing and headless testing without additional configuration. Playwright is also faster than some other automation tools due to its use of modern web technologies

  Question 10.What is the difference between Playwright and Puppeteer?
  10(a) Playwright is the first release as a fork of Puppeteer. Puppeteer is a node library that uses JavaScript to automate Chromium-based browsers. Even though Playwright started as one fork of Puppeteer, there are many key differences.

  10(b) Cross-browser interoperability is Playwright's key differentiator. It can power Firefox, Chromium, and WebKit (the Safari browser engine). Along with this, Playwright was able to enhance ergonomics in ways that might damage Puppeteer by beginning a new library.

  10(c) Playwright's page.click, for instance, waits for an element to be visible. Puppeteer still has room for improvement, although Playwright is sometimes a better option.

  10(d) The Playwright automation platform's more robust browser context features, which let you simulate many devices with a single instance, are the final notable difference. Multiple sites may be nested within a single browser context, and each context is independent of the others in terms of cookies and local storage.

  10(d) Contrarily, browser automation can be started quickly using Puppeteer testing. This is partially attributable to its simplicity of usage, as it manages Chrome using the unusual DevTools interface, makes it simple to intercept network requests, and offers more capabilities than Selenium.

   Question 11. How can We install Playwright with NodeJS?
   11(a) We can install Playwright easily from NodeJS. Here are the steps to follow:
   11(b) Launch a command prompt or terminal window.
   11(c) Go to the project directory where Playwright should be installed.
   11(d) To install the Playwright package, do the following command: npm install Playwright
   11(e) The most recent version of Playwright and its dependencies will be installed in your project directory.
   11(f)When the installation is finished, import Playwright into your JavaScript code: const { chromium } = require('Playwright');

   Question 12. Can you explain how Playwright's page object model works?
   A design technique called page object modeling enables us to model a group of objects to a certain page type. Despite its name, a page is only sometimes what it appears to be; it could be a part of the website. Here is how Page object model in Playwright works:

   (a).Define page object classes: Create classes that contain methods that correspond to the many interactions a user might have with the page, such as clicking buttons, typing text, and checking the page's status.

   (b).Encapsulate various page elements: The various web page components that your methods interact with can be contained within the page object class.

   (c).Create the page object: To instantiate the object, create a new instance of the page object class in your test code. This grants you access to the page object class's methods.

   (d). Use the Page object method for testing: Once your Page object model is generated, you can use those classes for test automation.

                                            OR

    POM stands for "Page Object Model," and it is a design pattern commonly used in test automation frameworks, including Playwright, to improve the organization and maintainability of automated tests. The main purpose of the Page Object Model is to create an abstraction of the web pages and their elements, allowing tests to interact with the application's UI in a more readable and maintainable way.

    In the Page Object Model:

    Page Objects: Each web page or screen in the application is represented by a separate Page Object. A Page Object is a class that encapsulates the UI elements and actions specific to that page. It provides a higher-level, more semantic API to interact with the page's components.

    Test Code: The actual test code interacts with the application using the methods and properties exposed by the Page Objects. The test code doesn't need to know about the underlying HTML structure or specific element locators, making it more robust and less prone to changes in the UI.

    Roles of POM in Playwright:
    1. Improved Readability and Maintainability: By abstracting the UI components and actions into Page Objects, the test code becomes more readable and easier to maintain. If there are any changes to the UI, you only need to update the relevant Page Object rather than modifying each test individually.

    2.Reusability: With Page Objects, you can reuse the same code for interacting with a specific page across multiple tests. This reduces code duplication and promotes a modular approach to test development.

    3.Encapsulation of Locators and Actions: Page Objects encapsulate the locators (selectors) and actions for each page, providing a centralized place to manage them. If the locators change due to UI updates, you only need to update the Page Object, not every test that interacts with that page.

    4.Separation of Concerns: POM helps in separating the UI logic from the test logic. Test cases become more focused on the test flow, making them easier to understand and maintain.

    Example of Page Object in Playwright:
    Let's consider a simple example for a login page:

     class LoginPage {
     constructor(page) {
     this.page = page;
    }

     async open() {
      await this.page.goto('<https://example.com/login>');
     }

       async enterCredentials(username, password) {
       await this.page.fill('#username', username);
       await this.page.fill('#password', password);
    }

      async clickLoginButton() {
      await this.page.click('button[type="submit"]');
          }
     }

      module.exports = LoginPage;

   Question 13.How does Playwright handle asynchronous operations?
   To handle asynchronous actions and run the test phases sequentially, Playwright employs the async/await keywords.Playwright's methods and functions return promises that resolve after the process is finished when you interact with a web page. For instance, when an element is clicked, the click method provides a promise that resolves. Before performing the next operation, you can use the await keyword to wait for the promise to resolve.

   Question 14.How does Playwright integrate with Continuous Integration (CI) tools?
   When code updates are posted to your repository, Playwright works seamlessly with Continuous Integration (CI) tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI, and others so that your tests run automatically. Here is the way you can integrate Playwright with CI tools:

   (a).Verify that a browser can be executed on the CI agent. The Linux agent's Playwright Docker image Utilizes command-line tools to install your dependencies.

   (b).Examine the documentation for the tools or frameworks you intend to integrate; many of these include thorough instructions on how to do so with the Playwright framework.

   (c).Utilize the Playwright automation framework's most recent version. The framework has been updated to make it easier to integrate with other systems.

   (d).Verify that the two frameworks' necessary dependencies are installed and configured.

   Question 15.What are some common challenges you've faced when using Playwright, and how did you overcome them?
   Playwright has certain drawbacks, such as not supporting Legacy Microsoft Edge or IE11, using emulators instead of real devices, and many more. However, here are some major common challenges with Playwrights with a possible solution:

   (a). Setting up and keeping the test environment up to date: Keeping the test environment up to date is one of the key Playwright difficulties. It can involve setting up browsers, installing dependencies, and configuring the test runner. The use of containerization solutions like Docker, which can provide a consistent testing environment across many computers and environments, is advised to address this difficulty.

   (b). Playwright test debugging: Playwright test debugging can be difficult, particularly when dealing with complex situations or intermittent failures. Using debugging tools, such as the Playwright CLI's debug command, which enables you to pause test execution and investigate the current state of the page and the test code, is one way to get around this problem.

   (c). Managing asynchronous activity: Asynchronous behavior is frequently included in Playwright testing, which can be difficult to manage. It is advised to use async/awaits syntax to get around this problem and make sure that the tests wait for the page to load and for the required behavior to happen before moving on to the next stage.

   Question 16.How do you debug tests in Playwright?
   Playwright offers various methods to debug tests, as mentioned below:

   (a). VS Code debugger: If you are using VS code extension, you can step through your tests while debugging them, view error messages, and create breakpoints. Here are the steps you can follow. If your test fails, VS Code will display error messages directly in the editor that include a call log, what was anticipated, and what was received.In VS Code, you may actively debug your test. Click on any of the locators in VS Code after running a test with the Show Browser checkbox selected, and it will be highlighted in the Browser window. You can see if there are several matches, thanks to Playwright.

   (b). Using the Playwright Command-Line Interface (CLI): Playwright has a command-line interface (CLI) with a debug command that enables you to halt the test execution and examine the current state of the page and the test code. Simply add the --debug flag to your test command to activate the debug command, and Playwright will halt test execution if it comes across a debugger statement in your test code.

   (c).Using the Playwright Inspector: While your test is running, you can interact with the page and examine its state using Playwright's interactive debugging tool, the Playwright Inspector. By adding the --inspect flag to your test command and then navigating to the given URL in your browser, you can start the Playwright Inspector.

   Question 17.What are some best practices for writing efficient and maintainable tests with Playwright?
   Here are some best practices for writing efficient test scripts with Playwright:

   (a).Use relevant test names that are descriptive and reflect the functionality when naming your tests. This makes comprehending the test's goal simpler, especially if you have a sizable test suite.

   (b).A test should be independent and atomic, meaning it should only test one object and not depend on the results of other tests. When a test fails, it is simpler to identify and address problems.

   (c).Your tests will be easier to comprehend and manage if page objects are used to encapsulate page-specific behavior. Page objects offer an abstraction layer that keeps the test code distinct from the page's implementation specifics.

   (d).The waitForSelector() and waitForNavigation() functions in Playwright are just two of the mechanisms available for waiting for elements and actions to finish. Utilize these techniques to manage timing concerns and guarantee the consistency and dependability of your testing.

   (e).Create logical groupings for your tests depending on the features or components. Create logical groups for your tests. It makes execution simpler to particular subsets of tests and helps comprehend the general structure of the test suite.

   (f). Use version control to coordinate with other team members and manage your test code. To automate your testing procedure and guarantee that your tests are run consistently and dependably, use continuous integration tools

   Question 18.What are some common errors you might encounter when using Playwright, and how do you troubleshoot them?
   Here is the list of errors you might encounter while using Playwright with solutions to solve it:

   (a).TimeoutError: When a Playwright operation takes longer to complete than the default timeout (30 seconds), this error may appear. If the operation is stuck because of a race condition or another problem, you can raise the timeout by giving a timeout option to the appropriate method.

   (b).SelectorTimeoutError: This error will appear when Playwright cannot locate an element on the page that matches a given selector. You can solve it by verifying that the selection is accurate and that the element is on the page when the test is run.

   (c).NavigationError: It appears during a DNS resolution error or a server fault, which can result in a navigation error. You can troubleshoot by verifying the URL and whether the server is up and operating.

   (d).ActionabilityError: This error appears when Playwright cannot carry out a specific action on an element, like clicking a button or entering text into a text field. You can solve it by checking whether the element is visible and in the proper condition for the operation to be performed can help you troubleshoot.

  Question 19.How do you stay up to date with new features and updates to the Playwright framework?
  There are various sources to be updated about Playwright automation frameworks, such as:

    Question 37. What are the common challenges faced in UI automation, and how do you overcome them?








    Question 38. How to access data from the fixture in playwright?
    In Playwright, you can use fixtures to set up and share data across multiple tests. Fixtures allow you to prepare data before the test starts and clean up after the test completes, ensuring a clean state for each test case.To access data from a fixture in Playwright, you can use the use function provided by the test runner (e.g., Jest, Mocha). Here's a step-by-step guide on how to access fixture data in your Playwright tests:
                                        or
    To access data from a fixture in Playwright with Mocha and Chai.js, you can use the Mocha test runner's beforeEach hook to set up the fixture data before each test case. The fixture data will be available in the test case as a context variable, which you can access and use in your tests. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this: 
        

    1.  Install Dependencies:
        Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed:
         npm install @playwright/test mocha chai

    2.  Create the Fixture:
        Define your fixture and its data. For example, let's create a fixture that provides login credentials:

        // loginFixture.js
         const { test } = require('@playwright/test');

         const loginFixture = test.fixtures(() => {
          const userData = {
           username: 'john_doe',
           password: 'test123',
          };
         return userData;
         });

          module.exports = { loginFixture };

    3. Write the Test:
        Create a test file (e.g., loginTest.js) where you will use the fixture data in your tests.
        // loginTest.js
         const { expect } = require('chai');
          const { test } = require('@playwright/test');
           const { loginFixture } = require('./loginFixture');

         test('Login Test', async ({ page, loginFixture }) => {
           const { username, password } = loginFixture;

         await page.goto('<https://example.com/login>');
         await page.fill('#username', username);
         await page.fill('#password', password);
         await page.click('button[type="submit"]');

           // Perform assertions as needed
            const url = await page.url();
         expect(url).to.include('dashboard');
         });

    4. Configure Mocha:
        Since you are using Mocha, you need to set up the Mocha test runner and configure it to use Playwright.
         # Use the following command to run the tests with Mocha
         npx mocha --timeout 60000 --require @playwright/test/mocha loginTest.js
          In the above command, --timeout specifies the test timeout in milliseconds, and --require @playwright/test/mocha enables Mocha to use Playwright.

    5. Run the Tests:
        Execute the test file using the Mocha test runner:
        npx mocha --timeout 60000 --require @playwright/test/mocha loginTest.js

        The Mocha test runner will automatically use the fixture and pass the fixture data to the test cases through the loginFixture parameter.

        With this setup, the test runner will execute the test, and the fixture data (login credentials) will be available in the test case as loginFixture. You can then use this data to perform the login actions and make assertions in your test case


    Question 39. How to generate  Allure reporting for Playwright Framework tests ?
    To generate Allure reporting for Playwright framework tests, you need to set up the necessary dependencies and configure the test runner accordingly. Playwright offers a built-in reporter for generating Allure reports. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:

    1. Install Dependencies:
    Make sure you have the @playwright/test package installed. If not, install it by running:
    npm install @playwright/test
    Additionally, install the playwright-reporter-allure package, which provides the Allure reporter:
    npm install playwright-reporter-allure.

    2. Configure Playwright Test Runner:
    Create a playwright.config.js file in your project root directory (if you don't have one already). In this configuration file, you can specify the reporter for generating Allure reports.

    // playwright.config.js
        module.exports = {
        use: {
    // Specify your browser(s) here, e.g., 'chromium', 'firefox', or 'webkit'
    browserName: 'chromium',
                                 },
    projects: [
    {
    name: 'Test Suite',
    testDir: './tests',
    reporters: [['allure', { outputDir: './reports/allure' }]],
             },
        ],
    };

    In the above configuration, we have specified the 'allure' reporter for Allure reporting. The reports will be generated in the reports/allure directory.  

    3. Run the Tests:
    To run your Playwright tests and generate the Allure report, use the following command
    npx playwright test
    This command will execute your tests and generate the Allure report in the specified output directory.

    4. View the Report:
    After the test execution is complete, you can view the generated Allure report. To view the report, navigate to the reports/allure directory and run the Allure server:
    npx allure serve
    This command will start the Allure server, and you can access the report by visiting the provided URL in your browser.
    The Allure report provides a comprehensive view of your test results, including test execution history, test case details, attachments (e.g., screenshots), and trends. It also offers interactive features like filtering, search, and the ability to mark test issues and add annotations.

    By using the Allure reporter, you can get detailed insights into your test execution and easily share test results with your team, making it easier to track test progress and analyze test failures.

    Question 40. How to generate HTML reporting for Playwright Framework test
    To generate HTML reporting for Playwright framework tests, you need to set up the necessary dependencies and configure the test runner accordingly. Playwright offers a built-in reporter for generating HTML reports. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:

    1.Install Dependencies:
               Make sure you have the @playwright/test package installed. If not, install it by running:
               npm install @playwright/test

               2. Configure Playwright Test Runner:
               Create a playwright.config.js file in your project root directory (if you don't have one already). In this configuration file, you can specify the reporter for generating HTML reports.

                  // playwright.config.js
                 module.exports = {
                    use: {
                  // Specify your browser(s) here, e.g., 'chromium', 'firefox', or 'webkit'
                  browserName: 'chromium',
                       },
                 projects: [
                   {
                   name: 'Test Suite',
                   testDir: './tests',
                   reporters: [['html', { outputDir: './reports/html' }]],
                                   },
                               ],
                           };
  
             In the above configuration, we have specified the 'html' reporter for HTML reporting. The reports will be generated in the reports/html directory.

                3.Run the Tests:
                  To run your Playwright tests and generate the HTML report, use the following command:
                   npx playwright test
                  This command will execute your tests and generate the HTML report in the specified output directory.

                4. View the Report:
                After the test execution is complete, you can view the generated HTML report. Navigate to the reports/html directory and open the index.html file in your browser to view the test results.

                The HTML report will provide detailed information about the test execution, including test names, status (pass/fail), test duration, and any error messages or stack traces for failed tests. The report will also display aggregate statistics, such as the total number of tests executed, the number of passed and failed tests, and the overall test pass rate.

                By using the HTML reporter, you can easily analyze and share the test results in a more visually appealing format, making it easier to identify test failures and understand test execution statistics.


    Question 41. Understand how playwright run tests in serial & parallel mode and update setting.?
           Playwright provides options to run tests in both serial and parallel modes, depending on your testing needs and project requirements. By default, Playwright runs tests in serial mode, executing them one after the other. However, you can enable parallel execution to run multiple tests concurrently, which can significantly reduce the overall test execution time.

           1. Serial Mode:
             In serial mode, Playwright runs the tests sequentially, one after another. Each test starts only after the previous test has finished. To run tests in serial mode, you don't need to make any specific configuration changes. It's the default behavior of Playwright.
              npx playwright test

            2. Parallel Mode:
             In parallel mode, Playwright runs multiple tests concurrently, utilizing the available system resources efficiently. Parallel execution can speed up the test execution time, especially if you have a large test suite.

             To run tests in parallel mode, you need to enable it in the playwright.config.js file. Create the configuration file if it doesn't exist, and add the workers option with the number of parallel workers you want to use. For example, to run tests with four parallel workers:
                 // playwright.config.js
                       module.exports = {
                          workers: 4,
                                   };
                  Now, when you run the tests, Playwright will execute them in parallel:
                  npx playwright test --workers 4

            3. Updating Settings:
            In addition to enabling parallel execution, you can update other settings in the playwright.config.js file to customize the test environment and browser behavior. Some commonly used settings include:

            use: Allows you to specify the browsers to be used for testing. For example, you can set it to 'chromium', 'firefox', or 'webkit'.

            headless: Determines whether the tests should run in headless mode (invisible browser) or in headed mode (visible browser).

            launchOptions: Lets you define additional options to customize browser launch behavior, such as viewport size or user agent.

            contextOptions: Allows you to specify context-specific options, such as storage state, permissions, or device emulation.

            Here's an example of a playwright.config.js file with some custom settings:

                   // playwright.config.js
                  module.exports = {
                    use: {
                      browserName: 'chromium',
                     channel: 'chrome',
                     },
                    headless: true,
                     launchOptions: {
                     viewport: { width: 1280, height: 720 },
                    },
                         contextOptions: {
                    storageState: 'state.json',
                                },
                             workers: 4, // For parallel execution
                          };

                Update the settings in this file according to your testing requirements.

                Remember to install Playwright's test runner package (@playwright/test) and any necessary browsers before running the tests:
                 npm install @playwright/test
                   npx playwright install

                With these settings and options, you can efficiently manage the execution of your Playwright tests, whether you choose to run them in serial or parallel mode. Additionally, customizing the settings allows you to tailor the test environment to meet your specific testing needs.

    Question 42. How to run tests parallelly from the same file by extending test option behavior's?
        In Playwright, you can run tests in parallel from the same file by extending the test option behavior using a test modifier. This approach allows you to execute multiple instances of the same test with different test data or configurations concurrently.

           Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve parallel test execution from the same file by extending the test option behavior:

            1.Install the necessary dependencies:
            Make sure you have the @playwright/test package installed. If not, install it by running:
                npm install @playwright/test

            2.Create your test file:
            Create a test file with the tests you want to run in parallel. For example, let's create a test file named loginTest.js with a simple login test:

                // loginTest.js
                const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');

                   test('Login Test', async ({ page }) => {
                   await page.goto('<https://example.com/login>');
                   await page.fill('#username', 'john_doe');
                   await page.fill('#password', 'test123');
                   await page.click('button[type="submit"]');
                   await page.waitForURL('<https://example.com/dashboard>');
                       });

            3. Extend the test behavior for parallel execution:
               To execute the same test in parallel with different configurations or data, you can use the test modifier. A test modifier is a function that takes the test function as an argument and returns a new test function with extended behavior.

                In this example, we'll use a test modifier to create multiple test instances with different login credentials. Save this code in a file named loginTest.parallel.js:

                 // loginTest.parallel.js
                    const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');

                       // Define the test modifier function
                    function loginTestModifier(username, password) {
                     return test.extend({
                      username: [username],
                       password: [password],
                        });
                         }

                  // Create two parallel test instances with different credentials
                       const parallelTests = [
                       loginTestModifier('user1', 'pass1'),
                       loginTestModifier('user2', 'pass2'),
                   ];

                    // Apply the test modifier to each instance
                       parallelTests.forEach((testInstance) => {
                       testInstance('Login Test', async ({ page, username, password }) => {
                       await page.goto('<https://example.com/login>');
                       await page.fill('#username', username);
                       await page.fill('#password', password);
                       await page.click('button[type="submit"]');
                       await page.waitForURL('<https://example.com/dashboard>');
                                      });
                         });
      
            4. Run the tests:
               Now, you can run the parallel tests using the Playwright test runner:
               npx playwright test loginTest.parallel.js
               The test runner will execute the tests concurrently, running each instance with different login credentials. This approach allows you to perform parallel testing on the same test logic while varying the test data or configurations.

            Note: In this example, we manually created test instances with different credentials. In real-world scenarios, you might want to use test data from external sources like databases, CSV files, or JSON files and dynamically generate test instances. This will allow you to scale parallel testing effectively.
      
    Question 43. How To Retry Failed Test Cases in playwright ?
         In Playwright, you can implement test case retries for failed tests to improve test stability and reduce flakiness. When a test fails, it will automatically be retried for the specified number of attempts before being marked as a final failure. This retry functionality can be achieved using the test runner's built-in test modifier.

         Here's how you can retry failed test cases in Playwright:

            1. Install Dependencies:
                Make sure you have the @playwright/test package installed. If not, install it by running:
                 npm install @playwright/test
            2. Configure Test Retries:
              Create a playwright.config.js file in your project root directory (if you don't have one already). In this configuration file, you can specify the number of retries for failed tests using the test modifier.
               // playwright.config.js
                  module.exports = {
                      use: {
                     // Specify your browser(s) here, e.g., 'chromium', 'firefox', or 'webkit'
                 browserName: 'chromium',
                     },
                      projects: [
                  {
                   name: 'Test Suite',
                    testDir: './tests',
                      retries: 2, // Number of retries for failed tests
                                             },
                                        ],
                                 };

        In the above configuration, we have set retries: 2, which means that each failed test case will be retried two more times after the initial failure.                     
    
        3. Implement Retry Logic:
            In your test file, you can use the test.flaky function to define the retry behavior for specific test cases. For example:

              javascript
                Copy code
                // loginTest.js
                  const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');

                      // Retry this test two more times if it fails
                        test.flaky('Login Test', async ({ page }) => {
                         await page.goto('<https://example.com/login>');
                         await page.fill('#username', 'john_doe');
                         await page.fill('#password', 'test123');
                          await page.click('button[type="submit"]');
                        await page.waitForURL('<https://example.com/dashboard>');
                         });
                    In this example, the Login Test will be retried two more times if it fails in any of the attempts.

        4. Run the Tests:
            To run your Playwright tests with retries, use the following command:

                bash
                Copy code
                npx playwright test
                The test runner will execute the tests, and if any test fails, it will automatically retry the specified number of times. If a test passes in any of the retries, it will be considered a pass. Otherwise, it will be marked as a final failure.

                By implementing test case retries, you can increase the stability and reliability of your Playwright tests, especially when dealing with flaky test scenarios. However, be cautious not to set the number of retries too high, as this might mask actual issues or prolong the test execution time unnecessarily. It's important to strike a balance between retries and timely feedback on test results.

    Question 44. Describe your approach to testing and improving QA?

            Question 45. List of soft and hard assertion in chai js ?
            In Chai.js, a popular assertion library for JavaScript, there are two types of assertions: "soft" assertions (also known as "assert" style) and "hard" assertions (also known as "should" and "expect" styles). The main difference between these two styles is how they are written and how they handle assertions.

            1. Soft Assertions (assert style):
               Soft assertions use the assert interface to check conditions and throw assertion errors when conditions are not met. They are more similar to traditional assertions found in other testing frameworks.

                   Example:
                   const assert = require('chai').assert;

                        const value = 5;
                        assert.equal(value, 5, 'Value should be equal to 5');

            2. Hard Assertions (should and expect styles):
               Hard assertions use either the "should" or "expect" interfaces. They provide more expressive and fluent syntax for writing assertions and allow chaining to make the code more readable.

               a. Should Style:

                         javascript
                           Copy code
                      const should = require('chai').should()
                         const value = 5;
                         value.should.equal(5);
                         
                b. Expect Style:

                                 javascript
                                   Copy code
                      const expect = require('chai').expect;
                      const value = 5;
                      expect(value).to.equal(5);
                      Both styles (should and expect) can be used interchangeably, depending on your preference and coding style.

    Question 46. What is the Different between Browser, Context and Page in Playwright ?
            In Playwright, "Browser," "Context," and "Page" are three important concepts related to web automation and testing. They represent different levels of abstraction and control when interacting with web pages. Let's break down each of them:

             1.Browser: A "Browser" in Playwright refers to the actual web browser application like Chromium, Firefox, or WebKit. Playwright supports automation for multiple browsers, and you can choose the browser you want to use based on your needs. Each browser has its own capabilities and performance characteristics. By creating a "Browser" instance, you can launch a specific browser and then create "Contexts" within that browser.

             2.Context: A "Context" represents a browsing session within a particular browser. It's like a new incognito window or tab that isolates cookies, storage, and other resources from other "Contexts." Multiple "Contexts" can be created within a single "Browser" instance, allowing you to simulate parallel browsing scenarios or perform separate tasks simultaneously. "Contexts" are particularly useful when you want to handle different user accounts or scenarios in isolation from each other.

             3.Page: A "Page" is the actual web page or tab opened within a specific "Context" of the browser. It represents the DOM (Document Object Model) and allows you to interact with the webpage's elements, perform actions like clicking buttons, filling forms, or capturing screenshots. You can manipulate the "Page" to simulate user interactions and gather information from the loaded web page.

                   To summarize:

                "Browser" represents the browser application itself.
                "Context" is an isolated browsing session within a specific browser.
                "Page" is a web page or tab opened within a "Context" that allows interaction with the web     page's content.
                Here's a basic code example in Playwright to illustrate the hierarchy:

                const { chromium } = require('playwright');

                  (async () => {
                    // Launch a browser
                       const browser = await chromium.launch();

                     //Create a new context (a new incognito window)
                       const context = await browser.newContext();

                     // Create a new page within the context
                        const page = await context.newPage();

                     // Interact with the page
                        await page.goto('<https://example.com>');
                        await page.fill('input[name="username"]', 'myusername');
                         await page.fill('input[name="password"]', 'mypassword');
                          await page.click('button[type="submit"]');

                           // Close the browser when done
                             await browser.close();
                               })();

    Question 47. What is Playwright Inspectors in Playwright and its role with Example during Web   automation Testing ?
              Playwright Inspectors is a set of tools provided by Playwright to facilitate web automation testing and debugging. These tools offer an interactive environment that allows you to inspect and understand the structure of web pages, test selectors, and experiment with Playwright API commands in real-time. It is particularly useful when you are writing automation scripts and need to verify or debug elements and interactions on web pages.   

              There are two main components of Playwright Inspectors:

             Playwright Test Runner with Inspect Mode: The Playwright Test Runner is a command-line tool that helps you run your Playwright tests and provides an interactive "Inspect Mode." When you run your tests with the --inspect flag, it pauses the test execution before the actual test starts and opens a browser window with DevTools enabled. You can then interactively inspect the page, try out selectors, and run Playwright commands manually to test their behavior. This allows you to validate the correctness of your selectors and commands before integrating them into your automated tests.

             Playwright Inspector (GUI Tool):The Playwright Inspector is a graphical user interface (GUI) tool that provides a dedicated environment for inspecting and debugging web pages using Playwright. It is similar to the DevTools provided by browsers, but it's enhanced with features specifically designed for Playwright users. With the Inspector, you can inspect the DOM, see element properties, test selectors, interact with the page, and observe the effects of Playwright commands in real-time.

             Example of using Playwright Inspectors during Web Automation Testing:

              Let's say you are automating a login process on a web application, and you want to interactively debug the login page using Playwright Inspectors.

                 Install Playwright Test Runner globally (if not already installed):
                  bash
                    Copy code
                    npm install -g @playwright/test

                    1. Create a Playwright test script, for example, login.spec.js:
                          javascript
                          Copy code
                          const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');

                      test('Login Test', async ({ page }) => {
                       await page.goto('<https://example.com/login>');
                       // Add your login automation steps here
                       // For example, fill the username and password fields and click the login button.
                            });

                             Run the test script with Inspect Mode:
                                   bash
                                   Copy code
                                  npx playwright test login.spec.js --inspect
                    The test execution will pause, and a new browser window will open with DevTools enabled. Here you can inspect the page, test selectors, and run Playwright commands directly to ensure they are working as expected.
                    If you prefer a graphical user interface, you can use the Playwright Inspector tool:
                    bash
                    Copy code
                    npx playwright inspector
                    The Inspector GUI will open, and you can enter the URL of the login page. Once the page is loaded, you can interactively debug and experiment with Playwright commands to ensure your automation steps are accurate.
                    Using Playwright Inspectors helps you validate and fine-tune your automation scripts during development, making the web automation testing process more efficient and reliable.

                            
    Question 48.What is Playwright Trace Viewers in Playwright and its role with Example during Web automation Testing ?
             Playwright Trace Viewers is a feature in Playwright that allows you to visualize and analyze the execution traces of your web automation scripts. Tracing captures detailed information about various events and actions that occur during the automation process, such as network requests, page lifecycle events, input actions, and more. The Trace Viewers enable you to inspect these traces in a human-readable format, making it easier to understand what happened during the test execution and identify potential issues or optimizations.
                Playwright provides two types of Trace Viewers:

                Trace Viewer (Command-line): The Trace Viewer is a command-line tool that you can use to generate and analyze traces. By running your Playwright tests with tracing enabled, you can generate a trace file (.trace) that contains a detailed record of all the events that occurred during the test execution. Afterward, you can use the Trace Viewer to open and explore these trace files, gaining insights into the browser's behavior, network activity, and your automation commands.

                 Playwright Inspector (with Tracing): As part of the Playwright Inspector (GUI tool), you also have the ability to enable tracing during test execution. When tracing is enabled, the Inspector captures the trace data in real-time while you interact with the page or run your automation scripts. The generated trace can then be viewed within the Inspector to analyze and debug the test execution visually.

                 Role of Playwright Trace Viewers in Web Automation Testing:

               When you are conducting web automation testing with Playwright, using Trace Viewers can be beneficial in several ways:

               Debugging and Troubleshooting: Traces provide a detailed log of events and actions, allowing you to investigate the test execution step-by-step. If something goes wrong during the automation process, the trace can help you pinpoint the issue and understand what caused it. You can inspect network requests, verify element interactions, and detect potential timing issues.

               Performance Analysis: By examining the trace data, you can identify performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization. Tracing helps you understand the loading behavior of web pages, measure page load times, and analyze network activity, enabling you to optimize your test scripts and improve the overall test efficiency. 

               Verification of Test Steps: Tracing allows you to validate that your automation test steps are correctly executed in the browser. You can verify that the expected actions are taking place, elements are interacting as intended, and network requests are being triggered appropriately.

               Example of using Playwright Trace Viewers during Web Automation Testing:
               To use Playwright Trace Viewers, you need to enable tracing in your test script. Here's an example:

                 const { chromium } = require('playwright');

                         (async () => {
                        const browser = await chromium.launch();
                        const context = await browser.newContext();
                        const page = await context.newPage();
                        // Enable tracing
                        await context.tracing.start({ screenshots: true, snapshots: true });
                        await page.goto('<https://example.com>');
                        await page.fill('input[name="username"]', 'myusername');
                        await page.fill('input[name="password"]', 'mypassword');
                         await page.click('button[type="submit"]');
                         // Stop tracing
                        const tracePath = await context.tracing.stop();
                       // Output the path to the trace file
                       console.log(`Trace file: ${tracePath}`);
                        await browser.close();
                         })();

                    In this example, we enable tracing with context.tracing.start(), perform some interactions on the "example.com" webpage, and then stop the tracing with context.tracing.stop(). The trace file will be saved, and you can use the Trace Viewer (command-line tool or the Playwright Inspector) to load and analyze the trace data for debugging and optimization purposes.
                    Overall, Playwright Trace Viewers serve as valuable tools to enhance the visibility and understanding of your web automation tests, enabling you to create more reliable and efficient test scripts.

    Question 49. What is Playwright  Codegen tools in Playwright and what its role with example during Web automation Testing of application ?
             Playwright Codegen is a powerful tool in Playwright that helps you generate code snippets for web automation testing. It allows you to interact with a web page using a regular web browser and records your interactions as you navigate and perform actions on the page. Once you are done with your interactions, Playwright Codegen converts those actions into code snippets in JavaScript (or other supported languages) that you can directly use in your automation scripts.

            The primary role of Playwright Codegen is to simplify and accelerate the process of writing automation scripts. Instead of manually identifying selectors, actions, and commands, you can rely on Codegen to produce accurate and efficient code based on your real-time interactions with the web application. This not only saves time but also reduces the chances of making errors in your test scripts.

            Using Playwright Codegen in Web Automation Testing:
            Let's see how you can use Playwright Codegen to create automation scripts for a web application.

            Install Playwright CLI:
            Make sure you have Playwright installed globally on your machine. If not, you can install it with npm:
                        bash
                        Copy code
                        npm install -g playwright

                        Launch Playwright Codegen:
                         Open your terminal and run the following command to start the Codegen tool:
                              bash
                               Copy code
                            npx playwright codegen <browser-name> <url>

             1.Interact with the Web Application: The Codegen tool will open the specified URL in the chosen browser. You can now interact with the web application as if you were using it normally. Perform actions like clicking buttons, filling forms, and navigating through different pages.

             2. Generate Code Snippets: As you interact with the web application, the Codegen tool records your actions. Once you are done with your interactions, the tool will generate code snippets representing the actions you performed.

             3. Copy Code Snippets to Automation Script: The generated code snippets will be displayed in the terminal. You can copy these snippets and use them in your Playwright automation script to reproduce the interactions you recorded.

                  Example:
                  Let's say you want to automate the login process of a web application using Playwright Codegen:
                  Launch Playwright Codegen:
                  bash
                  Copy code
                   npx playwright codegen chromium <https://example.com/login>

                 1.The Codegen tool will open "https://example.com/login" in the Chromium browser. You can now interact with the login page.

                 2.Perform the Login Actions:
                 a. Click the "Username" input field.
                 b. Type your username.
                 c. Click the "Password" input field.
                 d. Type your password.
                 e. Click the "Login" button.
                 3. Generate Code Snippets: After performing the login actions, the Codegen tool will generate code snippets like this:

    Question 50. What is visual testing & How to perform it using Playwright?
                  Visual testing, also known as visual regression testing, is a technique used in software testing to identify visual differences or regressions between different versions of a web application's user interface. It ensures that the UI remains consistent and visually accurate across various releases, updates, and changes to the application.

                  When performing visual testing, a baseline image of the web page is captured during the initial test run. Subsequent test runs compare the current state of the web page with the baseline image. Any visual differences detected are then flagged as potential regressions, allowing the testers to review and validate these changes to ensure they are intentional and acceptable.

                   Playwright provides built-in support for visual testing through its "Golden Snapshot" feature, which facilitates the comparison of screenshots captured during test execution with pre-established baseline images.

                   Here's how to perform visual testing using Playwright:

                     1. Install Playwright and other dependencies:
                        Ensure you have Playwright and Node.js installed in your project. You can create a new project or use an existing one.

                     2.Install Playwright's test runner and dependencies:
                       Install the Playwright test runner and other required dependencies by running the following command:
                       npm install @playwright/test expect

                       Write a visual test:
                          Create a new test file, for example, visual.test.js, and import the necessary modules.
                          javascript
                          Copy code
                          const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');
                          Define the visual test:
                          In the test file, define your visual test using the test function. You can use the page.screenshot() method provided by Playwright to capture screenshots during the test.

                          test('Visual test example', async ({ page }) => {
                            await page.goto('<https://example.com>');
                            // Capture a screenshot of the page
                              const screenshot = await page.screenshot();
                             // Use 'expect' to compare the screenshot with the baseline
                                 await expect(screenshot).toMatchSnapshot('example-page');
                                      });

                                      Run the visual test:
                               Run the visual test using the Playwright test runner:
                               bash
                               Copy code
                               npx playwright test visual.test.js

                               Review and update the baseline:
                         The first time you run the test, the test runner will save the captured screenshot as the baseline image (in the .golden folder). For subsequent test runs, the test runner will compare the captured screenshots with the baseline image. If any visual differences are detected, the test will fail, indicating potential visual regressions.

                          Review the differences carefully and determine if they are expected changes or actual regressions. If the changes are intentional, you can update the baseline image using the --update-snapshots flag when running the test: 
                          npx playwright test visual.test.js --update-snapshots

                          This command will update the baseline image with the new screenshot, marking the changes as accepted.

                          By following these steps, you can perform visual testing using Playwright to ensure the consistency and accuracy of your web application's user interface across different versions and changes.
